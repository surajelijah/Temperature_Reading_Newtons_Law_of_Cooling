# Temperature_Reading_Newtons_Law_of_Cooling
We hope to provide a code which allows us to predict and measure the temperatures quickly, so as to avoid the tedious calculations. This involves  Newtonâ€™s Law Of cooling, Junction Temperature Between metals, Mixture temperature of miscible fluids and solids, Temperature Required to Freeze solids within some time and many more
