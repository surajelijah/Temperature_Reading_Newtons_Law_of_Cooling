# Temperature_Reading_Newtons_Law_of_Cooling
We hope to provide a code which allows us to predict and measure the temperatures quickly, so as to avoid the tedious calculations. 
This involves 

- Newtonâ€™s Law Of cooling
- Junction Temperature Between metals
- Mixture temperature of miscible fluids and solids
- Temperature Required to Freeze solids within some time
- Temperature measurement based on length increment
- Temperature of region based on Pressure variations
- Inter conversions Between Temperature scales

The code is ready to use and can be made as an API if you need but this is an execuatable ready code and follow along
